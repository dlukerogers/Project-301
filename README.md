What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
We should bring up the conflict and discuss how to compromise. The hope is that we will be on board to being open to collaboration. Some personal sacrifice is needed.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Being open to confrontation is important. We should all be open to feedback and implementing said feedback when it is given to us. We should also encourage collaboration.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We should be patient towards eachother. Also we should give eachother the space to make mistakes and amicably correct eachother. We should make sure everyone is having their own growth moments.
